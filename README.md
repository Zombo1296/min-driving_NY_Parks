# min-driving_NY_Parks
Using Google maps API to calculate which New York State Park(89 of them) can be driving for reasonable times.
The use of travelling time is deprecated by Google Maps' term of use but I do not plan to use this in any commercial way. I'm just doing this for programming practise.
